I specialise in the Windows server infrastructure platforms with expertise in latest Microsoft technologies including but not limited to Windows server 2012/2016, Office 365, Azure, hyper-converged deployments, the full system center suite including SCCM SCVMM and SCOM. I also provide powershell consulting and training services.  For your server side I have experience with large multi-national finance houses and military networks down to the small business who rely on their IT more than ever in this changing world to drive business and profitability on the bottom line.

My pricing is highly affordable as I operate as a 1 man stop for all your needs in the small business to enterprise solutions, my overheads are low but my quality is high.
